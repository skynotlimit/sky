<h3>Money</h3>
<p>Money is a liquid asset used in the settlement of transactions.
  It functions based on the general acceptance of its value within a
  governmental economy and internationally through foreign exchange.
  The current value of monetary currency is not
  necessarily derived from the materials used to produce the note or coin.</p>
